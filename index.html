      <h1 class="first">Yes</h1>
      <h2 class="first">Nothing has changed in this update that should break as long as you are upgrading from OBS Studio 28+ and have up-to-date plugins and tools.</h2>
      <h2>You will want to verify that each of your plugins and tools such as chatbots have been updated for the new version of OBS.</h2>
      <h2>We highly recommend creating a backup of your scene collections and profiles before updating. Also, using a Portable Mode version of OBS helps make this process even easier.</h2>
