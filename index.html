      <h1 class="first">* Maybe</h1>
      <h2 class="first">* If you don't use StreamFX for anything, you can update as long as you test it out first in a portable installation with your scene collection. If you use StreamFX, the current alpha releases do not work with OBS 29. You will need to replace StreamFX with other plugins (if possible) or you will lose whatever StreamFX is adding to your current stream setup. There is no roadmap or timeline for StreamFX compatibilility so we'd highly recommend you begin to replace it.</h2>
